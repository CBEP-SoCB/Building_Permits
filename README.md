Data on residential housing permits, ultimately from the U.S Census Building 
Permits Survey

# Introduction
Housing data and housing starts reflect economic activity and signal level of
land use change during a period of time.  Federal sources track and make public 
town by town data on housing permits.  We downloaded and reorganized
data on housing starts for Casco Bay Watershed towns.  The data is archived 
here.

# Statement of Purpose
CBEP is committed to the ideal of open science.  Our State of the Bay data
archives ensure the science underlying the 2020 State of the Bay report is
documented and reproducible by others. The purpose of these archives is to
release raw data and data analysis code whenever possible to allow others to
review, critique, learn from, and build upon CBEP science.

# Archive Structure
CBEP 2020/2021 State of the Bay data analysis summaries contain a selection of 
data,  data analysis code, and visualization code as used to produce 
results shared via our most recent State of Casco Bay report. Usually, these
archives are organized into two or three folders, including the following:

- Data.  Contains data in simplified or derived form as used in our
data  analysis.  Associated metadata is contained in related Markdown documents,
usually `DATA_SOURCES.md` and `DATA_NOTES.md`.

- Analysis.  Contains one or more R Notebooks proceeding through the principal
data analysis steps that underpin SoCB reporting. To simplify the archives,
much preliminary analysis, and many analysis "dead ends" have been omitted. 

- Graphics.  Contains R Notebooks stepping through development of graphics, and
also copies of resulting graphics, usually in \*.png and \*.pdf formats.  These
graphics may differ from graphics as they appear in final State of the Bay
graphical layouts. Again, most draft versions of graphics have been omitted for 
clarity.

# Summary of Data Sources
Data was accessed via the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, 
Office of Policy Development and Research, State of the Cities Data Systems 
(SOCDS). Data is from the SOCDS Building Permits Database.  Data provides 
information on number of residential building permits issues by jurisdiction.
