# Introduction
Housing data and housing starts reflect economic activity and signal the level
of land use change ocurring at any given time.  Federal sources track and make
public town by town data on housing permits. Here we develop R code to
produce graphics similar to the graphic on building permits included in the 
State of Casco Bay report.  (The actual graphic used in the Report was produced
in Excel.  See the acompanying Excel Spreadsheet for details).

                             labels = c("Single", "Duplex", "Triple or Quad", 
                                        "Five or More", "Multifamily"))) %>%

It looks as though the proportion of single homes is inversely related to the 
total number of permitted housing units.  let's first look at the NUMBER of
housing units permitted in each year,a s a function of the total number 
permitted.

## Hot Real Estate Markets
### All Sizes of Structures Increase
```{r}
 long_totals <- totals %>%  pivot_longer(-c(Year, Total), 
                               names_to = "Size", 
                               values_to = "Count") %>%
  mutate(Size = factor(Size, levels = c("Single", "Duplex", "TripQuad", 
                                        "QuintPlus", "Multifamily"),
                             labels = c("Single", "Duplex", "Triple or Quad", 
                                        "Five or More", "Multifamily")))
```

```{r}
ggplot(long_totals, aes(Total, Count)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "gam", formula = y~s(x, k = 4)) +
  ylab("Number of Units Permitted") +
  xlab('Total Housing Units Permitted') +
  ggtitle("Residential Building Permits\nAll Watershed Towns") +
  facet_wrap(~Size, scales = 'free_y') +
  theme_cbep(base_size = 12) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8))
```
When the housing market is hot, the number of all types of housing being 
built goes up.  The relationship is not wildly far from linear for any size of 
housing (But note the different vertical scales!). 

### A Shift to Larger Units
```{r}
props <- totals %>%
  mutate(Single = Single/Total,
         Duplex = Duplex/Total,
         TripQuad = TripQuad / Total,
         QuintPlus = QuintPlus/Total,
         Multifamily = Multifamily / Total
         )
```

```{r}
cor(props)
```

So, Years with lots of new housing units are also years with large numbers of 
larger housing units, and a smaller proportion of single family dwellings.


```{r}
long_props <- props %>%  pivot_longer(-c(Year, Total), 
                               names_to = "Size", 
                               values_to = "Proportion") %>%
  mutate(Size = factor(Size, levels = c("Single", "Duplex", "TripQuad", 
                                        "QuintPlus", "Multifamily"),
                             labels = c("Single", "Duplex", "Triple or Quad", 
                                        "Five or More", "Multifamily")))
```

```{r}
ggplot(long_props, aes(Total, Proportion)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "gam", formula = y~s(x, k = 4)) +
  ylab("Proportion of Units Permitted") +
  xlab('Total Housing Units Permitted') +
  ggtitle("Residential Building Permits\nAll Watershed Towns") +
  facet_wrap(~Size, scales = 'free_y') +
  theme_cbep(base_size = 12) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8))
```

So, overall, when the housing market is hot, we tend to see construction  of 
relatively more multifamily structures.  Single family dwellings are 90% of
permitted dwellings when construction is slow, but drop to 75% when construction
is booming.

This is a correlation, so one should not interpret the results as simple 
causation, because it is not at all clear which way the arrow of causation runs,
or if both values change simultaneously due to market forces.
